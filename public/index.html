<h1>Offline Javascript AI-Agents </h1>
to make Ai-Agents with sensing and actuating abilities you need to understand LLM's. 
This page so far in January 2025 is about simpilfying and moving offline LLM's. 
Later wwe will start using webSerial to connect arduinos to these desktop LLM's. Eventually we will use edgeAI devices to do the same, add IoT such as LoRa and you have an
amazing combination of artificial brains and low energy microcontrollers working together, but best of all, simple enough that any High School student can learn.<br>
